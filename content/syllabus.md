Welcome to the Age of Data, where information is all around us, helping us live happier, healthier lives. Or does it? Do we know yet if cell phones cause cancer? Have we come to a decision on whether we should be eating lots of meat or none at all to stay healthy? Despite all of this information, it can be challenging to turn it into the knowledge from which we can make sound decisions. Statistics is the field that aims to bridge this gap between information and knowledge.

## Topics

**The primary goal of this course is for you to be able to critique and construct arguments using data**. The course is application-oriented introduction to statistical modeling and inference that spans a range of topics including:

- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Probability and random variable notation
- Study design
- Point and interval estimation
- Hypothesis tests
- Resampling procedures
- Multiple linear regression
- The Bayesian perspective on inference

A wide variety of applications from the natural and social sciences will be used. Our computation tool throughout will be the R language and all data analysis will be performed using a fully reproducible framework.


## Resources

### Textbook

The textbook associated with this course is [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by &#199;etinkaya-Rundel and Hardin. This is a free online textbook that can also be downloaded as a [pdf](https://leanpub.com/imstat) or ordered in [print](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Statistics-Mine-%C3%87etinkaya-Rundel/dp/1943450145/) for $15. It is also open-source, meaning that anyone can view and modify its [contents](https://github.com/openintrostat/ims/blob/master/index.Rmd) (take a look under the hood!).

### R

The software that we'll be using for our data analysis is the free and open-source language called R that we'll be interacting with via software called RStudio. As a Berkeley student, you have your own version of RStudio waiting you for at: [http://r.datahub.berkeley.edu](http:\\r.datahub.berkeley.edu).

## Course components

As a 4 unit course, you should plan to be engaged with this course roughly 12 hours each week:

- 3 hours lecture
- 2 hours lab
- 2 hours finishing up lab
- 2 hours studying (reviewing notes, reading textbook)
- 1 hour office hours, forum
- 2 hours problem set

Each week you'll be submitting a problem set and a lab. There will be two midterms and a final as well as a few short quizzes. Your final grade in the course will be computed based on:

- Problem sets 10%
- Labs 20%
- Quizzes 10%
- Midterm I 20%
- Midterm II 20%
- Final 20%

## Policies

### Accomodations for students with disabilities

Stat-20 is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed.  If you have Letters of Accommodations from the Disabled Studentsâ€™ Program or another authorized office, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements.

### Academic Integrity

You are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on problem sets and labs, but the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding and all of your collaborators must be cited. Researchers don't use one another's research without permission; scholars and students always use proper citations in papers; professors may not circulate or publish student papers without the writer's permission; and students may not circulate or post materials (handouts, exams, syllabi--any class materials) from their classes without the written permission of the instructor.

### Scheduling Conflicts

This course, Stat-20 Lecture 2 in Fall 2021, is held in-person and we expect that you'll be present in lecture and discussion section. We have built in some slack that allows for occasional absence, but if you are not able to be in-person, the fully remote section of Stat-20, Lecture 1, will be a better fit for you.

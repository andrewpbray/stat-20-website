subtitle: "Welcome to the Age of Data, where information is all around us, helping us live happier, healthier lives. Or does it? Do we know yet if cell phones cause cancer? Have we come to a decision on whether we should be eating lots of meat or none at all to stay healthy? Despite all of this information, it can be challenging to turn it into the knowledge from which we can make sound decisions. Statistics is the field that aims to bridge this gap between information and knowledge."

## Topics

This course is an application-oriented introduction to statistical modeling and inference. The topics that we'll be covering include:

- Study design
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization
- Probability and random variable notation
- Sampling distributions
- Point and interval estimates
- Hypothesis tests
- Resampling procedures
- Multiple linear regression
- The Bayesian perspective on inference

A wide variety of applications from the natural and social sciences will be used. Our computation tool throughout will be the R language and all data analysis will be performed using a fully reproducible framework.

## Policies

### Accomodations for students with disabilities

Stat-20 is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed.  If you have Letters of Accommodations from the Disabled Students’ Program or another authorized office, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements.

### Academic Integrity

You are a member of an academic community at one of the world’s leading research universities. Universities like Berkeley create knowledge that has a lasting impact in the world of ideas and on the lives of others; such knowledge can come from an undergraduate paper as well as the lab of an internationally known professor.  One of the most important values of an academic community is the balance between the free flow of ideas and the respect for the intellectual property of others. Researchers don't use one another's research without permission; scholars and students always use proper citations in papers; professors may not circulate or publish student papers without the writer's permission; and students may not circulate or post materials (handouts, exams, syllabi--any class materials) from their classes without the written permission of the instructor.

You are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on assignments, but all of your collaborators must be cited and the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding.

### Scheduling Conflicts

This course, Stat-20 Lecture 2 in Fall 2021, is held in-person and we expect that you'll be present in lecture and discussion section. We have built in some slack that allows for occasional absence, but if you are not able to be in-person, the fully remote section of Stat-20, Lecture 1, will be a better fit for you.
